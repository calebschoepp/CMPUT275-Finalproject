Running Instructions:
    1. After downloading the tar file extract it in your working directory with
        the command `tar -zxvf NAMEHERE`.
    2. Before going any further make sure that you have your Arduino Mega wired
        up correctly (see circuit-wiring.txt) and it is plugged into your
        computer.
    3. Now in the working directory call `ulimit -s 20000`, this makes the stack
        size big enough to run some of our algorithms.
    4. Now navigate into the client folder and run `make upload`.
    5. Now navigate into the server folder and run `maker server && ./server`.
    6. The program is now running, STEPS ON HOW TO ACUTALLY USE THE PROGRAM HERE TODO


Assumptions and Comments:
    - many debug statements are left in the code for easy tracing of the program
        in the terminal.


Makefile Targets:
TODO


Wiring Instructions:
    See circuit-wiring.txt in the root folder
